      <section id="methodology">
        <h3>What was our methodology?</h3>
        <p>The total size of the data-set was all companies registered with Companies House in the UK</p>
        <p>We then narrowed this data-set to companies who were obliged to publish gender pay gap information.</p>
        <p>This is a requirement for all companies with 250 or more employees</p>
        <p>Some companies with fewer than 250 employess have voluntarily published this data, they have also been included</p>

            <p>For pay data (salaries and bonuses), we have representative data.</p>
            <p>For example, pay is divided into 4 quartiles, (lower, lower-middle, upper-middle and upper).</p>
